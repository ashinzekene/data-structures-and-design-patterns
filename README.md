## Design Patterns

### Creational- Based on the concept of creating an object.
| Type        | Description
|-------------|-----------------------------------------
| **Class**
| Factory Method ✅	| This makes an instance of several derived classes based on interfaced data or events.
| **Object**
| Abstract Factory ✅  | Creates an instance of several families of classes without concrete classes.
| Builder ✅ | Separates object construction from its representation, always creates the same of object.
| Prototype ✅ | A fully initialized instance used for copying or cloning.
| Singleton ✅ | A class with only a single instance with global access point

### Structural  -   Based on the idea of building blocks of objects.
| Type        | Description
|-------------|-----------------------------------------
| **Class**
| Adapter ✅ | Match interfaces of different classes therefore classes can work together incompatible interfaces. 
| **Object**
| Adapter ✅ | Match interfaces of different classes therefore classes can work together incompatible interfaces. 
| Bridge ✅  | Separates an object's interface from its implementation so the two can independently.
| Composite ✅ | A structure of simple and composite objects which makes the total object than just the sum of its parts.
| Decorator | Dynamically add alternate processing to objects.
| Facade ✅  | A single class that hides the complexity of an entire subsystem.
| Flyweight ✅ | A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing of information that contained elsewhere.
| Proxy | A place holder object representing the true object.

### Behavioral  -  Based on the way objects play and work together.
| Type        | Description
|--------------|-----------------------------------------
| **Class**
| Interpreter | A way to include language elements in an application to match the grammar of the intended language.
| Template Method | Creates the shell of an algorithm in a method, then defer the exact steps to a subclass.
| **Object**
| Chain of Responsibility ✅ | A way of passing a request between a chain of objects to find the object that can handle the request.
| Command ✅ | Encapsulate a command request as an object to enable, logging and/or queuing of requests, and provides error - handling for unhandled requests.
| Iterator  | Sequentially access the elements of a collection without knowing the inner workings of the collection.
| Mediator  | Defines simplified communication between classes to prevent a group of classes from referring explicitly to each other.
| Memento | Capture an object's internal state to be able to restore it later.
| Observer ✅  | A way of notifying change to a number of classes to ensure consistency between the classes.
| State | Alter an object's behavior when its state changes.
| Strategy  | Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class separating the selection from the implementation.
| Visitor ✅ | Adds a new operation to a class without changing the class.
